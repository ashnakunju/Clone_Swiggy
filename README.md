Swiggy Clone Project (Bootstrap) As part of my web development journey, I created a responsive Swiggy clone using Bootstrap. This project replicates the core layout and design of the popular food delivery platform, featuring a clean UI, intuitive navigation, and mobile-friendly responsiveness. It helped me strengthen my front-end skills, especially in structuring components, styling with Bootstrap classes, and ensuring cross-device compatibility. This hands-on experience deepened my understanding of real-world web application design and user experience principles
